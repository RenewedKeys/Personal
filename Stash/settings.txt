###Stash ( App store ) 
- It uses Clash rules, I learned a small bit of what it can do so here is my recommendation: 
Settings:
MitM > OFF
Script > ON	
Rewrite > ON
On Demand > Always ON
Network:
Tunnel Only Mode ON 
Concurrent Mode ON
IPV6 Tunnel Routing ON ( if you have IPv6, otherwise OFF ) 
Everything else in that view OFF
